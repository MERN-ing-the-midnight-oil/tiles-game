Create the Grid:

Start by creating the grid where players will form words. It could be a simple 2D array to represent the grid cells.

Implementing Form Fields in the Grid
Grid with Input Fields:

    Each cell in your crossword grid can be an individual input field.
    You can create a grid layout using CSS (like grid or flexbox) and render input fields in each cell.
    Managing State:

    The value of each input field should be controlled by the state in your component.
    Use the useState hook to create a state variable that holds the current values of all the cells.
    Updating State:

    Attach an onChange handler to each input field.
    When the user types a letter into a cell, the onChange handler updates the state to reflect the new value.

Implement the Letter Pool:
Display a set of letters that the player can choose from. This can be an array of letter objects.
Enable Letter Placement:

Implement functionality to let the player place a letter from the pool into a grid cell.
Handle State Changes:

Ensure that placing a letter updates the grid and the letter pool appropriately.
Replenish the Letter Pool:

After a letter is used, randomly select a new letter from the bag to add to the pool.
