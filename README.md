# Rhys' Tiles Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).This program aims to simulate the popular tile placement game "bananagrams" where players put alphabet tiles down to form a crossword.

Currently a user can click on a grid space and type a letter which uses state to persist until page re-load.

This project shows that I can use and understand the useState hook.

Please take a look at my comments in "grid.js" which explain, in my own words, how useState works to update the array of values in my crossword grid.
